# RababHussain.github.io

My personal portfolio website hosted using github pages, built using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. This simple and effective website has helped me understand media queires in CSS and maintaining responsiveness when keeping smaller sized screens in mind. 


The portfolio consists of 5 primary sections all on a single webpage.
1). Home
2). About
3). Services
4). Portfolio
5). Contact

<b> # Home </b>
This is the landing screen which contains a logo, text and links to other sections on the page.

<b> #About </b>
A detailed personal profile of my skills, projects and academic details.

<b> #Services </b>
Services that I can offer displayed in a grid, with a link to the contact form linked to a google sheet that can help me track of inquiries.

<b> #Portfolio </b>
A list of projects that I have completed with a link to their respective github repositories at a click, offers a single click to my profile.

<b>#Contact</b>
Links to my email address, phone number and social links including whatsapp, instagram, linkedin and github. A simple form to contact/Message me with an inquiry, this form is linked to a google sheet using javascript that helps me track of requests.
